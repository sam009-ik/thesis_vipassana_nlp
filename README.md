# Thesis on Vipassana Meditation Analysis Using NLP

## Overview

This repository contains my ongoing thesis project focused on an in-depth analysis of Vipassana meditation through the lens of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and relational database management. My work represents a novel exploration of self and meditation practices, aiming to uncover latent topics and insights from interviews with Vipassana practitioners.

## Project Description

The core of my thesis revolves around analyzing 19 in-depth interviews with individuals who practice Vipassana meditation. By employing advanced NLP techniques and a meticulously structured MySQL relational database, I have managed to extract, organize, and analyze a vast array of data points that shed light on the profound impact of Vipassana on individuals' lives.

### Data Collection and Database Design

The data was gathered from carefully conducted interviews, and transcribed for further processing. A relational database in MySQL was designed to store and manage this data efficiently, allowing for intricate queries and analyses. This database includes a diverse range of data types, such as word-weight pairs, topics with associated weights, and detailed social location information of participants.

### NLP and Machine Learning Techniques

I utilized several NLP and machine learning techniques to analyze the transcribed texts, including:
- **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**: For discovering abstract topics within the interviews.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: To identify and categorize key entities mentioned in the texts.
- Analysis of self-reported scores: Providing quantitative measures of participants' experiences and outcomes from practicing Vipassana.

This combination of methodologies has enabled a comprehensive exploration of the qualitative data, revealing patterns, themes, and insights that would otherwise remain hidden.

## Objectives and Contributions

The aim of this thesis is not only to contribute to the academic study of meditation and mindfulness but also to demonstrate the power of combining technology and social science for deep, meaningful analysis. This project showcases my technical proficiency in programming, database management, and NLP, alongside my passion for exploring complex social phenomena.

## Repository Structure

- `thesis_mla.pdf`: The current draft of my thesis, including Chapters 2 and 3.
- `code/`: Directory containing all scripts used for data processing, NLP analysis, and database management.
- `transcripts/`: (Excluded from this repository for privacy reasons) Contains the raw and processed interview transcripts.
- `csv_data/`: All CSV files (initial ones, and newly created after a SQL query)
- `database/`: SQL scripts for creating and managing the MySQL database.
- `results/`: Visualizations and output from the NLP analysis and database queries.

## Future Work

As my thesis progresses, I plan to further enrich the database with additional analyses and explore more sophisticated NLP techniques to deepen the understanding of Vipassana's effects. This ongoing work will continue to highlight the intersection of technology and the humanities, contributing valuable insights into the practice of Vipassana and the study of mindfulness at large.
